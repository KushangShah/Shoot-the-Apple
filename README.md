# Shoot-the-Apple
My first every game ("Shoot The Apple")coded withe the help of Python 3. \n
This peace of code " Shoot.py " run a miniest game every, where you just have to click ok the the apple and function shows nice shoot, but if you miss the click than the code will show "You mised!" and quit the program itself.
In order to run the program User must keep in mind that "pgzrun /User/"location of life path"/shoot.py"
also make sure that the "images" folder and shoot.py are inside the same folder.
